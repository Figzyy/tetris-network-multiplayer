# Tetris*X

I want to fork and deploy a more evolved version of [Meth Meth Method's](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) version of [Multiplayer Tetris](https://github.com/meth-meth-method/tetris-network-multiplayer) 

# Any suggestions are welcome!

Im also deploying this somewhere.

Ill post a website later. Hopefully.
